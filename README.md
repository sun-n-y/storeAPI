### _goals_

- advanced filtering, sorting, and dynamically populating database
- many search options endpoints

---

### _notes_

- frontend only responsible for http calls, backend does all the heavy lifting
  - server is designed to handle large amounts of data and make computations
  - over 100 items, frontend will be overwhelmed and be slow
  - ready to go endpoints where you only fetch the data
  -
